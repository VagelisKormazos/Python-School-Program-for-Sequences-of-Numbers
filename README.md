# Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences Calculator ðŸ“ˆ

This Python program allows users to perform basic calculations related to **Arithmetic** and **Geometric sequences** through a simple console menu.  
You can calculate both specific terms and the sums of sequences.

## Features âœ¨
- Find the **n-th term** of an arithmetic sequence.
- Calculate the **sum** of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence.
- Find the **n-th term** of a geometric sequence.
- Calculate the **sum** of the first n terms of a geometric sequence.
- User-friendly menu for multiple calculations.

## Educational Purpose ðŸŽ“
This project is designed to help **students** learn and practice basic concepts of **Computer Science**, including:
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Loops** (`while`)
- **Functions** (function definitions and usage)
- **Basic File Organization** (separating code into modules like `functions.py` and `main.py`)
- **Introduction to Classes** (future extension idea)

It is ideal for **beginners** who want to understand the logic behind sequences and **improve their programming skills** at the same time!
